# Barista - Coffee Shop POS Fullstack App with Login

This is coffe shop point-of-sale inspired fullstack application with login authentification. It is inpired by Avatar the Last Airbender's Jasmine Dragon Tea Shop - since I love tea and ATLA, it felt fitting for this theme. "Cashiers" can put in the customer name to track the order, and choose from a variety of menu options, size small, medium and large to create an order. Cashiers/Baristas can log in and sign up to see the pending orders, and complete orders and update them to a different section. Additionally, this also includes text-to-voice function that reads out orders.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Passport, EJS

This project allowed me to create a new type of update - to update orders in a new section. I was able to use EJS and manipulate properties server-side to distinguish which orders were completed or not after the user clicks the coffee cup to update. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to create a more complex CRUD application with login, and also create a new update method in the server.
